WeakAuras is a powerful and flexible framework that allows you to display highly customizable graphics on your screen to indicate buffs, debuffs, and a whole host of similar types of information. It was originally meant to be a lightweight replacement for Power Auras, but it now incorporates many features that Power Auras does not, while still remaining more efficient and easy to use.

Features include:
An intuitive and powerful configuration interface
Custom textures including all textures from Power Auras and the new Cataclysm spell alerts
Progress bars and textures that show the exact duration of auras
Displays based on auras, health, power (mana, rage, soul shards, holy power, etc.), cooldowns, combat events, runes, totems, items, and many other triggers
Preset and user-defined animations
Custom side-effects such as chat announcements or sounds
Grouping, which allows multiple displays to be positioned and configured at the same time
CPU optimizations such as conditional loading/unloading of displays, modularity, and prevention of full aura scanning
Powerful customization options, such as animation paths, on-show/on-hide code, and custom triggers, for Lua-savvy users
